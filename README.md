# JobManagementSystem
This is a group of three subject project which is to develop a distributed and generic job management solution. 
Each user will submit jobs from a Master node and the job management system should dispatch them to dedicated 
remote Worker machines for execution. Eventually, the results of a job execution should be returned to the Master. 
My work are as follow;

- Established communication among the Master node and Worker nodes. 
- Implemented monitor of the health status of the Workers nodes(running, active, dead)
- Handled failures and exceptions.
